# Invariant register

### INV-0001

Class: legal
Concepts: Install, Asset
Statement: The repository contains no bytes taken from an install and no code transcribed from the game's program; tests build their fixtures in code, and rules recovered from the program are described in our own words.
Breaks: silently
Check: `RepositoryContentTests` fails on a file with the extension of an install's file types; no cheap test can tell a copied byte sequence or a transcribed routine from an original one, so reviewers check that fixtures are built in code and that recovered rules are restated, not transcribed.
